Attila Klenik, Mentor/Project Maintainer

Hyperledger Foundation

<br>
Dear Klenik,

I am writing to express my interest as a mentee in the Hyperledger Caliper documentation platform. I learned about the program through a peer at the ALX software engineering program I recently graduated from, we were having a discussion on opportunities to gain hands-on experience with real-world projects and he mentioned the Linux Foundation Mentorship program, the Hyperledger Mentorship Program top be specific, I was immediately drawn to the opportunity to further develop my skills and contribute to open-source projects under the guidance of experienced mentors.

One thing about the program that particularly sparked my interest is the amount of learning support promised to mentees, I believe this aligns my values. I am a very open-minded person and I am always willing to learn and adapt to new environments, and I follow instructions meticulously. Throughout my academic and professional career, I have demonstrated my ability to work and thrive in a team setting, and I believe thatâ€™s what open source is about, collaboration. I am excited about the prospect of collaborating with like-minded individuals and contributing to impactful projects.

As a full-stack software developer and a technical writer, I have developed strong written communication skills through many different projects and experiences of mine. I am quite proficient in using markdown and documentation frameworks to effectively communicate certain technical concepts. Also, while I may not have prior experience with Hyperledger Caliper, I am very eager to learn and I am very committed to acquiring the necessary knowledge to contribute meaningfully to the project.

Regarding what I hope to gain from this mentorship experience, I am very eager to expand my technical skills and also gain valuable knowledge about blockchain technology, specifically within the context of Hyperledger Caliper. I am also looking forward to learning the best practices for open-source development and project management from mentors. Also, I aim to leverage this opportunity to make meaningful contributions to the open source community.

Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of joining your program and I am eager to contribute to its success.

Best regards,

Abdul-Hameed Osilaja.
